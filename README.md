# Programmers-Testers-withObserver-Pattern

There are testers and programmers in an IT company. The testers report issues to the programmers. Only programmers can resolve issues. Once an issue is reported it appears in the window of every programmer. An issue can be deleted only after it is solved by a programmer. A programmer chooses one issue from the unsolved ones and solves it. Once it is solved it appears to all the other user (programmer and testers) that the issue is solved.
